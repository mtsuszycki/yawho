Yawho (Yet Another Who) is a who-like program.

Program shows standard informations about users currently on the machine
(current process, username, tty, "from")
but has two additional columns not seen in other 'w' programs:

DAEMON - shows connection type ie. ssh, telnet
SHP - pid of the login shell (helpful if you are an ugly administrator
	that whishes to kill someone's sesssion ;-)

Usage: yawho [-l] [username ...]
	-l	long display - don't cut processes names
